                    <p>Geographically, a network can be seen in one of the following categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth-enabled devices, ranging not more than a few meters.</li>
                        <li>It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors.</li>
                        <li>It may be spanned across a whole city.</li>
                        <li>It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces.</li>

                    <p>Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion. By connectedness, we mean either logically, physically, or both ways.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Every single device can be connected</b> - To every other device on the network, making the network mesh.</li>
                        <li><b>All devices can be connected</b> - To a single medium but geographically disconnected, creating a bus-like structure.</li>
                        <li><b>Each device is connected</b> - To its left and right peers only, creating a linear structure.</li>

                    <h3>ADMINISTRATION</h3>
                    <p>From an administratorâ€™s point of view, a network can be a private network which belongs to a single autonomous system and cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain. Or a network can be public, which is accessed by all.</p>
        
                    <h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>
                    <p>Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>There can be one or more systems acting as a Server</b> - Others being Clients, request the Server to serve requests. The Server takes and processes requests on behalf of clients.</li>
                        <li><b>Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point</b> - Or in a back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and are called peers.</li>
                        <li><b>There can be a hybrid network</b> - Which involves network architecture or both the above types.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
                    <p>Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices</li>
                        <li>Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP</li>
                        <li>Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages</li>
                        <li>Information sharing by using the Web or Internet</li>

                <h2>Computer Network Topologies</h2>
                <p>A network topology is the arrangement with which computer systems or network devices are connected to each other. Topologies may define both physical and logical aspects of the network. Both logical and physical topologies could be the same or different within a network.</p>
       
                    <li><b>Point-to-Point:</b><br>
                        Point-to-point networks contain exactly two hosts, such as computers, switches, routers, or servers, connected back-to-back using a single piece of cable. Often, the receiving end of one host is connected to the sending end of the other and vice versa. Point-to-point (PTP) topology connects two nodes directly together. If the hosts are connected point-to-point logically, there may be multiple intermediate devices, but the end hosts are unaware of the underlying network and see each other as if they are connected directly.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><b>Bus Topology:</b><br>
                        In a Bus topology, all devices attach to the same transmission medium. The medium has a physical beginning and end. All buses are implemented using electrical cables, usually coaxial, and the ends of the cable must be terminated with a resistor that matches the impedance of the cable. The terminating resistor prevents data reflections from causing data corruption. The bus is considered a multi-point system because all devices tap into the same backbone cable.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><b>Star Topology:</b><br>
                        In a star network, each node (file server, workstations, and peripherals) is connected to a central device called a hub. The hub takes a signal that comes from any node and passes it along to all the other nodes in the network. Data on a star network passes through the hub, switch, or concentrator before continuing to its destination. The hub, switch, or concentrator manages and controls all functions of the network. The star topology reduces the chance of network failure by connecting all of the systems to a central node.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><b>Mesh Topology:</b><br>
                        In this topology, each node is connected to every other node in the network. Implementing the mesh topology is expensive and difficult. In this type of network, each node may send messages to the destination through multiple paths. While the data is traveling on the Mesh Network, it is automatically configured to reach the destination by taking the shortest route, which means the least number of hops.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><b>Ring Topology:</b><br>
                        In a ring network, every device has exactly two neighbors for communication purposes. All messages travel through a ring in the same direction. A failure in any cable or device breaks the loop and can take down the entire network. To implement a ring network, it could use Token Ring technology. A token, or small data packet, is continuously passed around the network. When a device needs to transmit, it reserves the token for the next trip around and attaches its data packet to it.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><b>Tree Topology:</b><br>
                        A Tree Network Topology is basically a combination of bus and star topologies. It merges the characteristics of both bus and star topologies. A bus topology connects all computers in a network through a common communication medium, with terminators at both ends of the cable to absorb signals. On the other hand, a star network topology connects all computers with a central hub for sharing information and other useful resources.
